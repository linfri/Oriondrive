# Oriondrive

Oriondrive is a REST (Representational State Transfer) API, which aims to generate music with text-to-speech voice, with the text generated by various algorithms and AI models. The project grew out of artistic collaboration with [Thomas Jackson Park](https://github.com/Mystified131), a co-creator of the [GenerIter SDK](https://github.com/GridPresence/GenerIter), and it all started from a creative block when Thomas asked me to contribute vocals to his music. Since the music material by Thomas was purely algorithmic/generative, I decided to play with back then newly released GPT-2 model by OpenAI and feed the output to the speech synthesizer, and make literally all the other aspects of music making generative, even cover artwork. This train of thought, coupled with my interest in machine learning and full-time studies of statistics and data analysis, led me to the idea of creating the software backbone supporting this functionality, and developing it as a hobby project in parallel with my studies, aiming towards generation of fully produced tracks with voice and text provided by models trained on my own datasets. Basically, the "vocalist" should be able to talk/rap/ramble about the topics that the user would choose, with specific word choices, and the music background should be provided by the GenerIter SDK, rearranging/recomposing samples created by me and, probably, others. 

## Roadmap

As of now, a GET request without any params produces a wave file generated with the help of Amazon Polly text-to-speech, with the content provided by the "happy feedback" function of the `bhappyr` package, completed by the GPT-2 model trained by DeepAI. I'm going to add the custom prompt functionality, the option of having Markov chain models, pre-trained by me for specific topics on specific datasets, providing "food for thought" for GPT-2, in the next few months. Then, after getting satisfactory results, I'm going to connect GenerIter and make the whole thing work together. A lot of things to do, but I'm in no rush at all :)
