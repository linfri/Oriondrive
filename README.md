# Oriondrive

## Roadmap

Uh oh... there's a LOT to do and to explain.

How the project came about, where it's heading and what's the plan.

I'll describe it all properly soon.

Meanwhile... the script generates only three voices. I'll keep the happy feedback stuff, rewrite it all in OOP, it's going to be separate methods for everything. Happy feedback, custom prompt, the Markov chain models, trained for specific occurences. Once it's done and once I'm done with the Python course, I am going to connect GenerIter through reticulate to this thing, and signal processing (the delays and all the other usual stuff). Lots to do but it can and will be done :)
