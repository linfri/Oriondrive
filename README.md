# Oriondrive

Oriondrive is a REST (Representational State Transfer) API by Linn Friberg, which aims to generate music with text-to-speech voice, with the text generated by various algorithms and AI models. The project grew out of artistic collaboration with [Thomas Jackson Park](https://github.com/Mystified131), a co-creator of the [GenerIter SDK](https://github.com/GridPresence/GenerIter), and it all started from a creative block Linn was experiencing when Thomas asked her to contribute vocals to his music. Since the music material by Thomas was purely algorithmic/generative, Linn decided to play with back then newly released GPT-2 model by OpenAI and feed the output to the speech synthesizer, and make literally all the other aspects of music making generative, even cover artwork. This train of thought, coupled with her interest in machine learning and full-time studies of statistics and data analysis, led her to the idea of creating the software backbone supporting this functionality, and developing it as a hobby project in parallel with her studies, aiming towards generation of fully produced tracks with voice and text provided by models trained on her own datasets. Basically, the "vocalist" should be able to talk/rap/ramble about the topics that the user would choose, with specific word choices, and the music background should be provided by the GenerIter SDK, rearranging/recomposing music samples created by Linn and, probably, others. The API is written in R (Plumber), and integration with Python code by Thomas via `reticulate` will be added later.

## Installation and Usage

As of now, the API is deployed on [Heroku]( https://radiant-woodland-99773.herokuapp.com/__docs__/), and the source code is available within this repo. If you wish to deploy the API on your own machine, you will need [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You will need an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account as well, in order to access Amazon Polly text-to-speech synthesizer. `Dockerfile`, as well as `heroku.yml` (for Heroku), are provided here too. You will need to provide your AWS keys via `aws_key.txt` and `aws_secret.txt`, and the DeepAI key as well via `deepai_key.txt` (obtainable either [here](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator) or via creating a free account).

Dependencies: `tuneR`, `httr`, `aws.polly`, `bhappyr`, `remotes`.

As of now, a `GET` request to `/wav` without any params generates a wave file produced with the help of Amazon Polly text-to-speech, with the content provided by the "happy feedback" function of the `bhappyr` package, completed by the GPT-2 model trained by DeepAI. Try it out [here]( https://radiant-woodland-99773.herokuapp.com/wav).

## Roadmap

The custom prompt functionality, the option of having Markov chain models, pre-trained by Linn for specific topics on specific datasets and providing "food for thought" for GPT-2, will be added in the next few months. Then, after getting satisfactory results, the GenerIter will be added to Oriondrive as a dependency as an attempt to make the whole thing work together.
